# Tic-tac-toe
I try to create Tic-tac-toe game using basic python and without using any python Modules. Tic-tac-toe or X's and O's is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
